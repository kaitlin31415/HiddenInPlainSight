## Testing 

How to Run the Tests using junit:
Open command prompt and set the directory to the HiddenInPlainSight file directory.

#### Windows:

1. junit-4.12.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar are already in the folder (you do not need to redownload these).
2. Compile your code and the test code using the commands
```
javac -cp .;junit-4.12.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar HIPS/testing/*.java
javac HIPS/backend/*.java 
javac HIPS/Runner/*.java
``` 
3. Run the test using the command 
```
java -cp .;junit-4.12.jar;hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore HIPS.testing.RunTesting
```
#### Unix:

1. junit-4.12.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar are already in the folder (you do not need to redownload these).
2. Compile your code and the test code using the commands 
```
javac -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar HIPS/testing/*.java
javac HIPS/backend/*.java 
javac HIPS/Runner/*.java
``` 
3. Run the test using the command 
```
java -cp .:junit-4.12.jar:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore HIPS.testing.RunTesting
```
